# CONTROLS
 * J/K - up/down
 * Enter - select demo
 * Space - show/hide menu
 * R - reset / next
 * Shift click - zoom in (only on some)
 * Ctrl click - zoom out (only on some)

# TODO
 * font rendering
 * clean up, put on gh
 * ponder scene registry further
 * colour based on sized for perco
 * show paths in mandelbrot
 * slider MMB to reset
 * slider scroll for fine
 * fractals are upside down


# DEMO IDEAS:
* rgb noiser
* rgb noise transitions
* percolizer could go all the way down or all the way up to change seed
* PP imagine a matrix of 'what eats what'

## Predator Prey
Just need parameters where more not necessarily == better
 * per parameter mutation rate
 * chance to skip turn: lets you save energy: save next turn as well
 * tiredness: skip but as 
 * give birth threshold: because too low and the kids will die
    * is this identical to number of kids? maybe not, like you could seriously hang on until the good times come
 * x/y of map to inhabit....
 * explorativeness: chance to walk away from where you have been vs go back
 * red and green grass: digestion preference, should be a nice auto niche

 some of these are just for adapting but red and green is definite niche material
 imagine evolving a matrix... thats like the structure of a nn


## Fractals
You can tell that the mandelbrot set, julia set are self referential

possible fractals: things you can do to a Vec2
if mandelbrot is // p such that |(((p^2 + p)^2 + p)^2 + p)^2 + ...| <= 2.0
julia is p such that |(((p2 + p)^2 + p)^2 + ...| <= 2.0
just snuck in a constant at the start
what if we defined a fractal as a dual process of 2 points fighting, ie subtracting
(p1^2 - p2^2)^2 + p1)^2 - p2^2 ...

get em multithreaded, simd for responsive / higher res
its an extremely parallel task
even cuda fractals hey, or in fragment shader
but anyway threads could return just some arrays that get joined. maybe moves and stuff optimize it
f32x8 best? but its got dependence. so just the bailout will be as slow as the last one

maybe plotting orbits over the julia set they will make more sense

honestly a better colouring algorithm for deeper steps would be good
can you just do some log shit to turn up the steps heaps? cause it gets lame

is there some kind of fast stop computing for mandelbrot

LOL f64s are so good

## rgbutm
ways of exploring automatically, e.g. distribution of age over time. measurement of contained energy
shortest and most beautiful lives?
average age vs chaos, or most uniform age
number of cycles past x and y
or every 1000 erase an area and reset yourself
what if the states were periodic

// lines, i think i must be calculating the width wrong


why do the bulbs in the mandelbrot set have periods as they do?
mandelbrot and julia next to each other for C selection
pandelbrot, wouldnt need as much recalculating, just do 1 row of pixels at a time


for voronoi I might need to basically animate the algorithm lol. bad triangles, poly, etc.

hmm software renderer would be juicy for a pixel game

do some voronoise

do some 3d noise animations
some animated noise would look sick honestly
can I have a better scene registry sorta thing or do I need C for that? cant seem to do much cool functional/closure shit in rust. like in Go its no worries.

value noise but the values arent uniform distributed, theyre exp distributed. or like some main chance to be low. that could even be given by another noise fn. so its like holey

maybe its trait magic needed
i dont actually want an array of trait objects but I do want a table of function pointers returning trait objects

fancy hashing: just ones that hash into the same bucket
like kademlia
you could randomly sample with a hash function

scaledown opportunity: just do everything in NDC space?

Destructo BW: go through and delete all the bad triangles without replacing, would actually be cool
this is actually a sick re meshing operation, good for level gen

like bruh you could even do a super ghetto version of this
also makes me think of diamond square
it actually looks sick. inb4 its actually good

level gen as perturbations of a mesh / bitmap

be good if i had a mesh viewer renderer

could have a triangulation based thing walk around leaving areas 

adding triangles outside ? like get points within radius

you could just walk a random ass triangulizer that picks points within a radius hey

noise where things were instead set to 0 or 1 with a certain probability


inputs: scroll mousewheel needs to go in as do key repeats



you want some composable node structure dont you
like a scene graph
monad shit
